		<h1>Heading 1</h1>
			<p>I can't wait to dig in and write me some code! I'm hoping we won't run into any more snags...</p>
		<h2>Heading 2</h2>
			<p>Thank Heaven for Lee Pender and his patient guidance!! He is very tolerant of my outdated equipment.</p>
		<h3>Heading 3</h3>
			<p>I was tempted to buy a brand new computer instead of working out the kinks of this grouchy old hp. Unfortunately for Lee, I take stubborn pride in getting by with prehistoric electronic devices.</p>
		<h4>Heading 4</h4>
			<p>Also I'm broke... but more to the point, I really enjoy working through a challenging puzzle, and getting this slow-poke computer to cooperate was certainly a challenge.</p>
		<h5>Heading 5</h5>
			<p>Now that the set up is complete, I think the course itself will be a rewarding and worthwhile challenge as well.  I'm excited to get started!</p>
		<h6>Heading 6</h6>
			<p>To conclude this first activity, instead of Lorem Ipsum, I'd like to use a different Latin excerpt that seems appropriate at the moment: Veni, Vidi, Vici.
			Cranky Computer: 0. Margie: 1.</p>
