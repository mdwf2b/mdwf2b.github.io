		<p>Hello! My name is Margie, which, as you probably know, is short for Margaret. Just to keep things interesting however, my parents decided to go with a <em>slightly</em> different pronounciation, and I'm <strong>so</strong> glad they did! Instead of saying <em>Margie</em> with a <strong>soft</strong> 'g' like you would normally hear, they called me <em>Margie</em> with a <strong>hard</strong> 'g', just like it's pronounced in the name <em>Margaret</em>.  So really it makes more sense to pronounce it that way. I've always really liked my name, and I think our names are a <strong>huge</strong> part of our identity, so I'm grateful my parents decided to think outside the box a little.</p>
